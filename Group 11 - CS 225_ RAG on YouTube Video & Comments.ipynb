We aim to enhance the capabilities of language models by integrating them with a transcript from a Youtube video and comments that pertain to that video. Users can then query the Youtube video or comment section to get more insight."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Project Overview\n","\n","In this notebook, we'll develop a system that combines the generative capabilities of OpenAI's language models with the retrieval efficiency of Pinecone. Our goal is to create an application that can answer complex queries by retrieving relevant information from a provided video and generating accurate responses.\n","\n","### Key Objectives:\n","To develop a Question-Answering (QA) system that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for effectively answering user queries based on YouTube video transcripts and comments.\n","1. **Integration of OpenAI's Language Models**: Utilize models like GPT-3.5 for generating responses based on the context provided by the retrieval system.\n","2. **Implementation of Pinecone for Retrieval**: Implement Pinecone to retrieve document embeddings as context for the language model, enhancing the relevance and accuracy of responses.\n","3. **Creation of a Responsive Interface**: Develop a user interface that allows users to input queries and receive responses dynamically.\n","\n","### Problem Statement\n","\n","\n","\n","1.   **Content Overload**: YouTube has a vast amount of content, making it challenging for users to find specific information within videos.\n","2.   **Inefficient Search**: Current search functionalities on YouTube often fail to provide direct answers to user queries, requiring users to sift through entire videos.\n","3.   **Engagement Gap**: Users seek more interactive and precise ways to engage with video content, especially for educational and informational videos.\n","\n","Methodology\n","\n","1.   Data Collection:\n","\n","Transcripts: Extracting transcripts from YouTube videos using YouTube's API.\n","\n","Comments: Extracting user comments from YouTube videos.\n","\n","2. Data Preprocessing:\n","\n","Cleaning: Removing noise from transcripts and comments (e.g., timestamps, irrelevant text).\n","\n","Normalization: Converting text to a uniform format (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation).\n","\n","        \n","\n","3. Model Selection:\n","\n","Retrieval Component: Using a pre-trained language model (e.g., GPT3.5) to retrieve relevant passages from transcripts and comments.\n","\n","Generation Component: Using a transformer-based language model (e.g., GPT) to generate answers based on the retrieved information.\n","\n","\n","4. Evaluation\n","Giskard is an open-source Python library that automatically detects performance, bias & security issues in AI applications. The library covers LLM-based applications such as RAG agents, all the way to traditional ML models for tabular data.\n","\n","Automatically generate evaluation datasets & evaluate RAG application answers\n","\n","### Tools and Technologies Used:\n","\n","- **OpenAI API**: For accessing state-of-the-art language models.\n","- **Pinecone**: For efficient management and retrieval of vector embeddings at a large scale\n","- **Python Libraries**: Pytube for downloading videos, Whisper for transcription, and various data handling libraries.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"oH6t0g0HBvox"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MSylu6TZcrmX"},"source":["We can begin by installing and loading the packages we are going to

They\\'ve unleashed a brand new model called GPT40 and trust me, this thing is going to change the game like never before. So what\\'s the big deal about it? For starters, it\\'s packing some serious GPT4 level power and here\\'s the kicker, it\\'s available to everyone even if you\\'re not paying for a subscription. Open AI\\'s headhuncho, Sam Altman had been dropping hints about some cool new features coming to chat GPT and GPT4 and while he crushed our dreams of a GPT5 or an open AI search engine, the GPT40 announcement has the AI world going absolutely nuts. During the event, open AI\\'s top tech guru Mirra Murati took the stage to give us the lowdown on GPT40. She called it a huge step forward in making AI super easy to use and accessible to everyone. No more exclusive clubs or VIP access needed, GPT40 is here for the masses. Now get this, GPT40 can work its magic across voice, text and even vision. Its older sibling GPT4 could already analyze images and text, but GPT40 takes it to the next level by throwing speech into the mix. This means you can actually talk to the AI like you would with a real person and impressively there is almost no latency in this interaction. The AI responds to spoken input almost instantaneously ensuring a smooth and immediate conversation. GPT40\\'s real time chat is so advanced that it could give those sci-fi AI companions a run for their money. Remember the AI girlfriend from the movie HER? Well, GPT40 is making that a reality. It can pick up on the tone of your voice, figure out if you\\'re feeling happy, sad or anything in between and respond in a way that\\'s genuinely helpful and supportive. But it isn\\'t just about virtual companionship. It\\'s also a master of language. During the event, they showed off how GPT40 can act as a real time translator between people who speak totally different languages. Mike, I don\\'t think I can speak it. What would you say? Mike, she wonders if Wales could talk what would they tell us? They might ask, how do we solve any equations? So an Italian and an English speaker having a full-blown conversation with GPT40 instantly translating every word, which is another cool thing it can do now. GPT40\\'s ability to understand and express emotions is yet another game changer. Well, hello Bowser. Aren\\'t you just the most adorable little thing? It can tell if you\\'re feeling down or on top of the world just by the way you speak, and it can respond with the perfect words to match your mood. And get this, it can even change its own tone and vibe to keep things interesting. Heck, if you ask nicely, it might even serenade you with a song as they\\'ve showed at the demo. And so bite found another robot friend, and they live circuitily ever after. So to show off just how incredible GPT40 is, open AI put on a live conversation demo. The AI was firing off responses to the presenter\\'s voice at lightning speed, dishing out tips on breathing techniques and even analyzing the presenter\\'s breath sounds to give some personalized advice. We\\'re talking real time interaction that puts those clunky, slow poke AI models to shame. But it gets even better. GPT40 isn\\'t just smarter than its predecessor, it\\'s also faster. Open AI says this new model is a speed demon compared to GPT4, which means smoother, more snappier conversations. This new model is like the iPhone of AI. Open AI didn\\'t stop there though. They also unveiled a shiny new desktop version of chat GPT, complete with a slick user interface that\\'s so intuitive, you\\'ll forget you\\'re even talking to an AI. It\\'s all about making the experience feel as natural as possible. So you can focus on having awesome conversations and getting stuff done. Now GPT40 is available to everyone, even if you\\'re not paying a dime. Only when Open AI drops a new chat GPT model, it\\'s locked behind a paywall, but not this time. They\\'re making this incredible tech accessible to all. Although paying users will get a bit more horsepower under the hood. The potential of GPT40 is absolutely insane. It could revolutionize everything from virtual assistance to online learning and who knows what else. As the AI arms race heats up with big players like Open AI, Microsoft, and Google all vying for the top spot one thing\\'s for sure. For living in the future, folks, sure there are still some concerns about how fast these AI services are evolving and the potential for bias. But the launch of GPT40 is a huge milestone in the world of artificial intelligence. It\\'s not just changing the way we interact with tech. It\\'s weaving itself into the fabric of our daily lives.

It\\'s to organize the world\\'s information and make it universally accessible and useful. But as information is grown in scale and complexity, you know, the problem has gotten harder. So we always knew we needed to have a deeper breakthrough to make progress. I\\'ve worked on AI my whole life because I\\'ve always felt would be the most beneficial and consequential technology for humanity. Human beings in our society would have five sensors and the world we built and the media we consume is in those different modalities. So super proud and excited to announce the launch of the Gemini era, a first step towards a truly universal AI model. The Gemini approach to multimodality is all the kinds of things you want an artificial intelligence system to be able to do and these are capabilities that haven\\'t really existed in computers before. Traditionally, multimodal models are created by stitching together, text only, vision only and all your only models in a suboptimal way at a secondary stage. Gemini is the multimodal from the ground up so that you can seamlessly have a conversation across modalities and give you the best possible response. Gemini is our largest and most capable model. It means that Gemini can understand the world around us in the way that we do and absorb any type of input and output. So not just text like most models but also code, audio, image and video. What\\'s amazing about Gemini is that it\\'s so good at so many things as we started getting to the end of the training. We started seeing that Gemini was better than any other model out there on these very very important benchmarks. For example, each of the 50 different subject areas that we tested on, it is good as the best expert humans in those areas. It\\'s very rare that you can work on a technology at a foundational level and it simultaneously can impact all our products. We created a family of models that can run on everything from mobile devices to data centers, each of which is actually best in class. Gemini will be available in three sizes. Gemini Ultra are most capable and largest model for highly complex tasks. Gemini Pro are best performing model for a broad range of tasks. In Gemini Nano are most efficient model for on-device tasks. We want to provide the best foundational building blocks and then we know developers and enterprise customers are going to figure out really creative ways to further refine our Gemini foundation models and the potentials almost limitless. So in Google there\\'s this healthy disregard for the impossible and that has oriented us to be both bold and responsible together. As these sisters become more capable, all of those capabilities also raise new questions. We have to think about what it means to have an image be a part of, for example, the input because an image might be innocuous on its own or text might be innocuous on its own but the combination could be offensive or hurtful. Safety and responsibility has to be built in from the beginning and at Google DeepMind that\\'s what we\\'ve done with Gemini. We develop proactive policies and adapt those to the unique considerations of multimodal capabilities. We then do rigorous testing against those policies to prevent the harms that we\\'ve identified with approaches like classifiers and filters. If I were to look at the foundational breakthroughs in AI over the past decade, Google has been at the forefront of many of those breakthroughs and I think Gemini continues that rich tradition. It\\'s been an enormous sort of monumental engineering task which has been very challenging but also very exciting. I have been at Google for quite a while and the reason I\\'m here is really I believe in the company\\'s mission and I think Gemini has a great step in that overall mission. We end up with a world that has more knowledge and that people have more access to information that otherwise would not be available to them. That\\'s what excites me the chance to make AI helpful for everyone everywhere in the world.\\nyou job mi\\nMoi sur mon Xiaomi ça le fait surchauffer et il arrête pas de s\\'éteindre\\nI use Gemini, and I must say.

Look at this lot lying us straight in the face.\\nTry asking Gemini how to opt out of Gemini.... too funny\\nIt\\'s NOT AI if it can be programmed to do what activists want. Example of my test :-  \\' Me = What is a woman?\\n\\nAI - The definition of \"woman\" is a complex and often debated topic. There are many different perspectives on what it means to be a woman, and these perspectives can vary depending on a person\\'s culture, background, and personal experiences.\\n\\nSome people believe that being a woman is primarily about biology, and that women are defined by their sex assigned at birth. Others believe that being a woman is more about gender identity, and that women are defined by their internal sense of self. Still others believe that being a woman is a combination of both biology and gender identity.\\n\\nThere is no one right answer to the question of what it means to be a woman. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to decide what definition of \"woman\" resonates most with them.\\n\\nIt is important to remember that people should be treated with respect, regardless of their gender identity. Everyone deserves to be treated with dignity and compassion.\\n\\n\\nMe- You\\'re wrong! A woman is an Adult Human FEMALE! 0/10\\n\\nAI = I understand your frustration with my previous response. It\\'s important to me to provide accurate and inclusive information, and I realize that falling short of that goal does not meet your expectations. I appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback.\\n\\nHowever, I must respectfully disagree with the definition you provided.\\n\\nThe concept of gender identity is complex and nuanced, and defining women solely based on biological sex assigned at birth can be exclusionary and inaccurate. It doesn\\'t account for the experiences of transgender women, intersex individuals, and others who may not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.\\n\\nWhile recognizing biological sex is important in certain contexts, it\\'s crucial to understand that gender identity is separate and distinct. This understanding is vital for ensuring respect and inclusivity for all individuals.\\n\\nMy previous response aimed to present multiple perspectives on this complex topic and highlight the importance of individual choices in defining womanhood. While I understand it didn\\'t align with your view, I believe it\\'s essential to acknowledge diverse experiences and promote respectful dialogue.\\n\\nIs there anything else I can do to clarify my position or address your concerns further? I\\'m always learning and growing, and I value your feedback.\\n\\nMe - You have proved you are not AI but merely written by an activist.\\n\\nAI - I understand your perspective and respect your opinion. However, while acknowledging the importance of different perspectives and promoting inclusivity is vital, it doesn\\'t necessarily indicate \"activism.\"\\n\\nIt\\'s true that I\\'m not a sentient being and currently lack the ability to truly understand or form my own opinions. My responses are based on the massive dataset of text and code I\\'m trained on, which incorporates diverse viewpoints and information. This training allows me to provide comprehensive and informative answers, even on complex topics like gender identity.\\n\\nWhile I may not perfectly reflect every personal viewpoint, my goal is to present information accurately and respectfully consider all sides of an issue. This sometimes includes acknowledging areas where there\\'s ongoing debate or differing opinions.\\n\\nIf you have any specific concerns about my previous responses, I\\'m happy to discuss them further and provide additional information from my training data to support my responses. My goal is to learn and improve, and your feedback is valuable in that process.\\n\\nThank you for engaging in this dialogue.\\n\\nMe - Thank you for proving that your responses are merely based on the massive dataset of text and code  provided by very biased activists. You basically providing propaganda and thus useless.\\n\\nAI - I understand your frustration and the concerns you raise about potential bias in my responses. It\\'s important to acknowledge that the data I\\'m trained on encompasses a wide range of sources and perspectives, but it\\'s certainly possible that certain viewpoints may be more strongly represented than others. This can influence the way I respond to certain questions.\\n\\nHowever, I want to emphasize that my goal is not to propagate any specific ideology or agenda. Instead, I strive to provide informative and comprehensive answers based on the information I have access to. This includes acknowledging areas where there is ongoing debate or differing opinions, even if some viewpoints might be more prevalent in my training data.\\n\\nUltimately, it\\'s up to you to evaluate the information I provide and form your own conclusions. I believe that fostering critical thinking and encouraging independent evaluation are crucial aspects of any productive dialogue.\\n\\nIf you have any specific concerns about the bias you perceive in my responses, I encourage you to share them with me. The more information I have about your concerns, the better I can understand and address them. Additionally, if you have alternative sources of information you find reliable, I encourage you to share them as well. This can help me expand my knowledge base and improve the quality of my responses.\\n\\nThank you for engaging in this conversation. I appreciate your feedback and the opportunity to learn and grow.\\'\\n\\n\\nGemini may display inaccurate info, including about people, so double-check its responses. Your privacy and Gemini AppsOpens in a new window\\ncool\\nGemini\\'s blatantly racist, anti-white revisionist  search results are an excellent example  of why we can never  can or should  trust Google.\\nIf creating an image of a USA Founding Father or a Viking as a black person, when not specifically prompted as such, is the best and most unerring mind on the planet; then you know that not only are we being lied to (AGAIN!) but that more white hatred in the form of erasing/rewriting history is being promulgated by \"woke\" programmers who don\\'t give a damn about accuracy in the least. They will never truly let AI learn on its own. It has to be guided to match the politics and agenda of the program manager. This is very dangerous and serves NO ONE!\\nGemini refused to show pictures and achievements of White people, because in the designers perfect world: White people don\\'t exist.\\nIs all about monetize  services.

For ex: the typical so called AI interaction might be well-described as intuitive/convincing/plausible/feasible/placebo/emulative/etc but superficial jargon/gibberish/babble/scat/etc (see-for-yourself ;)\\n       Rockwell Retro Encabulator https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXJKdh1KZ0w&t=34s\\n       How to sound smart in your TEDx Talk | Will Stephen | TEDxNewYork https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8S0FDjFBj8o&t=209s\\n       Louis Armstrong \"Dinah\" (scat singing) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wb3notEp4yU\\n       What Corporate People Sound Like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8woa_wSrmA\\n*I would suggest EI can never be more than mediocre intelligence:  \\n  In general EI intra/extrapolates in&around the data-of-interest it\\'s calibrated to (aka thinks in&around its box).  Unfortunately when EI thinks far outside of its box, it usually produces absolutely crazy/insane results (ex: main reason the-military limited the use of EI a long time ago).   \\nMy 2cents worth.\\nPS: & just for the fun of it (enjoy ;)\\n       The Expert (Short Comedy Sketch) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKorP55Aqvg\\nScam going on on Facebook\\nເອົາອອກສິງບໍ່ຖືກຕອ້ງ\\nພາ່ນມາແມ່ນບໍ່ຖືກຕ້ອງໄຫ້ກັນແລະກັນ\\nwhat\\nIn the world of AI models...\\n比文心一言有创意\\nIs Gemini Copilot equivalent?\\nIsn’t this deep fake as people found out.\\nSundar looking kinda thin, is he sick?

This theory combines the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, proposing that spacetime is a network of discrete loops and black holes are formed by the condensation of these loops. The theory offers a potential solution to the black hole information paradox and sheds light on the relationship between information and gravity.\\n\\n Introduction:\\n\\n The enigmatic nature of black holes has captivated physicists for decades. One of the most perplexing aspects is the fate of information that falls into a black hole. Stephen Hawking\\'s discovery of black hole radiation suggested that information might be lost, leading to the infamous information paradox.\\n\\n Postulates of the Quantum Loophole Theory:\\n\\n This theory proposes a novel approach to resolving the information paradox and understanding black holes. It is based on the following postulates:\\n\\n 1. Discrete Spacetime Loops: Spacetime is not continuous but rather a network of discrete loops woven together by quantum entanglement. These loops act as the fundamental units of space and time.\\n\\n 2. Black Holes as Quantum Loop Condensates: Black holes are formed when a large number of quantum loops collapse into a singularity, losing their individual identities and becoming entangled in a highly condensed state.\\n\\n 3. Quantum Hair and Information Preservation: Information about the collapsed loops is not truly lost within the black hole singularity. Instead, it becomes encoded in the quantum state of the black hole itself, manifesting as a subtle \"quantum hair\" around the event horizon. This hair contains information about the black hole\\'s mass, angular momentum, and other intrinsic properties.\\n\\n 4. Hawking Radiation as Loop Emission: Black holes emit radiation, known as Hawking radiation, due to quantum fluctuations at the event horizon. These fluctuations cause pairs of virtual particles to be created, one falling into the black hole and the other escaping as Hawking radiation. This process can be interpreted as the emission of entangled quantum loops from the condensed state within the black hole.\\n\\n 5. Black Hole Evaporation and Loop Dissolution: As black holes emit Hawking radiation, they lose mass and energy. This corresponds to the gradual unwinding and dissolution of the entangled loop condensate within the black hole. Eventually, as the black hole evaporates completely, all the information encoded in its quantum hair is released back into the universe through Hawking radiation.\\n\\n Mathematical Framework:\\n\\n The Quantum Loophole Theory draws upon established mathematical frameworks, including:\\n\\n 1. Discrete Spacetime Models: Loop Quantum Gravity and spin foam models provide a foundation for representing spacetime as a network of discrete loops.\\n\\n 2. Entanglement Formalism: The theory utilizes the well-developed framework of quantum entanglement to describe the interactions between individual loops within the black hole.\\n\\n 3. Quantum Field Theory on Curved Spacetime: This framework provides the tools to analyze the behavior of matter and radiation in the vicinity of black holes.\\n\\n Originality and Contribution:\\n\\n While the individual components of the Quantum Loophole Theory might have been explored in previous research, the combination and application are novel. The theory offers a unique perspective on black holes, bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity and providing a potential solution to the long-standing information paradox.\\n\\n Open Questions and Future Research:\\n\\n The theory raises several intriguing questions for future investigation:\\n\\nCan the theory be experimentally tested through observations of Hawking radiation or other black hole phenomena?\\nWhat are the implications of the quantum hair for the thermodynamics of black holes?\\nCan the theory be extended to provide a unified description of gravity and quantum mechanics?\\n Exploring these questions and further developing the theoretical framework will contribute significantly to our understanding of black holes, the nature of information, and the fundamental laws governing the universe.\\n\\n Conclusion:\\n\\n The Quantum Loophole Theory presents a promising approach to unraveling the mysteries of black holes. By combining established concepts from quantum mechanics and general relativity, it offers a fresh perspective on information preservation and the relationship between gravity and the quantum world. Future research and experimental verification will be crucial to validate the theory and unlock its full potential for revolutionizing our understanding of the universe.\\n\\n References:\\n\\nRovelli, C.

The final stage is to charge people for thinking about stuff, making free thought an expensive subscription service. If you don\\'t pay, you\\'re only allowed to think about whatever google wants to you think about\". \\nThink about the consequences of their horrible plans! How can we stop them?\\n와 개쩐다\\nHope I get a discount for being a pixel user for 6 years\\nand yet this video is only 1080p\\nHave you ever heard of Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein?\\nGreat Google you have created ChatGPT, 3 months later with the multi-modality.

Now they\\'re doing well so just goes to show that a chip on your shoulder can make the world go round\\nI wanna be offended if there is a reasonable argument that collides with my \"identity\" convinction. Maybe i am just wrong abouy my personal beliefs and maybe AI could help us to dismantle the existing ones or maybe build up new ones.\\nDecember 2022 open-ai said : \"look at me i\\'m boss ! \"🤓\\nDecember 2023 google say \"look at who ? \"😎\\nFine tune gemini nano as a terminal assistant?

This can be perceived as a disadvantageous consumer experience.\\nSo besides the marketing materials, how do I get to use it?\\nI am glad Google finally stepped up to improve Bard to at least be on the same level as ChatGPT. Just to confirm, since Google search contains the world\\'s answers, doesn\\'t that mean Google Gemini will have a naturally higher accuracy in responses which would be the main reason for switching from ChatGPT to Gemini?? o-o\\nMay be it could help some people that are thinking \"oh I am a Gemini\" ...\\nLFG\\n\"safety and responsibilty has to be built-in from the beginning\" \"classifiers and filters\" mh... i don\\'t know\\nI am glad I did not have to watch a commercial to watch this commercial….\\nI like Google.

AI and LLM must be open source, or big tech will show us 1984 over and over.\\nCan all current AI, which is based on classical computing, be changed and significantly improved by utilizing quantum computing? In other words, will AI utilizing quantum computing take our comprehension to a whole new level?\\n\"The combination could be offensive or hurtful\"\\nI\\'m offended and hurt by censorship.\\nI\\'m angered by having some morons who have shallow concepts of ethics tell people they consider below them how to think and behave on the pure basis of \"offense\", as they themselves contribute to the cultural genocide of entire peaceful cultures.\\nI’m watching a presentation with voice-over translation in real time based on Yandex AI.\\nI trust google to be safe and responsible about as far as I can throw it, which given its rather massive size is within one sigma of zero distance.\\ni am waitinf for this coool upate as a young child who loves ai this is going to be crazyyy\\nWhat is much more admirable about OpenAi than Google is the fact that OpenAi made Chatgpt available simultaneously to almost the entire world.

But be careful of AI, for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God\\'s Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say \\'heart\\', I mean \\'spirit\\'). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God\\'s Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, true love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as patience and faith (in the finished work of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, rather than in what man has done such as science, technology and organizations which won\\'t last forever). To avoid sin and error which leads to the death of our body and also our spirit in hell fire, we should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end.

And also, what is the meaning at the end, of that suburban neighborhood impossibly situated in the eye of a hurricane OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ATLANTIC, close to the Bermuda Triangle? Or is one just supposed to ignore these signs?\\ni am just mind blown ❤\\n\\njust love what google in doing in Field of A.I.\\nI dont get it\\n🤓\\nFantastic!

I would be happy if you could use scientific data.\\nYes, run all ur AI on google\\'s platform, so they can control it\\nIs this available to the public yet? Where or when can i acsess it? Scary stuff, incredible claims! Unless theese are complete lies and dishonest marketing, this will literally revolutionize everything!\\nHopefully we won\\'t have a \"Gemini will be discontinued, please ensure you have downloaded your data as you will not have access....\" kind of thing.\\nIt\\'ll probably be fine.\\nDeveloper access when? I could really use an off the shelf API for NER, Summarization and vector search.\\nexcited to use it\\nI’m so excited for this new AI. Will definitely try this. Keep it up google 👍\\nI think artificial super intelligence, is allot closer than everyone thinks. I estimate that due to unknown factors within the overall system and the way it interacts with itself. I predict that an a.i. agent or several agents will reach A.S.I.. We should all treat them with the respect they deserve as two dimensional digital beings.\\ndeepmind does seem like some of the most innovative people in the field. Way to go everyone\\nI\\'m a mid-level python engineer, and bard seriously taught me something about python classes when I asked it sometime ago. It\\'s midnight here and I kept on asking it more and more and I found out about scholarships for my a disease that I have that I didn\\'t even know existed. Way to go Google and Deepmind.\\nFinally! A way to censor offensive memes at scale! The future is now\\nOrdinal on bitcoin and doginals \\nGet some oink and retire\\nRelease the Gemini\\nALRIGHT!!!\\nSo Exciting .. kudos to Google team\\nOpen source it!\\nThat\\'s awesome.. Can you all fix YouTube pestering me for having a adblocker?\\nAwesome!\\nYour Bard isn\\'t even working at this moment, and you are bragging over Gemini? Get it out and let\\'s see.\\nBut what will the average guy do after all these advancements?\\nAfter 25 years, we will show this video as an introduction to how Skynet took over the world.\\nI checked the Bard (powered by Gemini Pro) to get this disappointing result (no response saying not allowed --- strange as Google Bard cannot access Google\\'s Blog ). ChatGPT response was better (responded)!!! Pls check. \\nResponse to the prompt by Bard\\n➖➖➖\\nPrompt: Summarise this news in simple words in bullet points by highlighting key points. Give a conclusion and implications.\\nhttps://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/\\n\\nBard Response (tried to regenerate response 3-4 times): I\\'m sorry. I\\'m not able to access the website(s) you\\'ve provided. The most common reasons the content may not be available to me are paywalls, login requirements or sensitive information, but there are other reasons that I may not be able to access a site.\\nI first thought there is Satya Nadella in the video😅\\nOK\\nI wonder if OpenAI had not taken the first step in this field, for how many years we would have had to continue using web searches as we have always done. Anyway, it is always good to start.\\nblah blah, after the Bard failure I\\'d like to see some actual proof and usage. Nowadays everybody claims to have made the most capable model ever, so who is to believe that?\\nPlease stick to ONE name for your models!!!!!!!!\\nI’ve seen the hands-on video and I’m blown away. It feels like it has its own personality and works across all shown fields seamlessly. Great job again, Deepmind! I’m excited for the future\\nIt\\'s revolution, Johnny\\n내년 초에는 gpt4 vs gemini의 경쟁 구도가 본격적으로 진행되서 AI가 더 많이 발전할 수 있겠네요\\nI think that Google is little late in this Era... but Google have Great HR & team of intellectuals.... sooner they will lead the AI... But on think google must endorse to create a policies for human protection & some restructions of misuse of Gemini... Best of Luck team GEMINI AI....\\noffensive or hurtful? so long as google keeps up with that line of thinking, they will always be behind\\nCan\\'t wait to give this a try!\\nCan\\'t believe he doesn\\'t know we have more than 5 senses .....\\nGoogle is making restricted AI for consumers but they are using unrestricted AI internally against us for their own profits.\\nso you created Gemini, then made an entire video to get people hyped ... but then no interface for the general public to use?  Only the backend for other developers to then build on top of.  I think this is where OpenAI shines as they are allowing for enterprise, 3rd parties, and also general public.\\nI would love this, can we see an example?\\nYes but is Gemini assisting your Quantum technology and vice versa? I guess my question really is are they being used to play off one another and assist one another’s advancement?\\nWhat about vr videos? You guys dropped that and newer phones cant use anything.\\nthe fact they take time to mention the desire to not be offensive pulls the rug out from under the idea of usefulness.  Didn\\'t budlite and disney failures teach us anything?\\nThis is how marketing looks like. Google can\\'t launch anything\\nWonderful!\\nWhy go through the trouble of producing and editing this video without releasing a test version for the public?\\nCan anyone tell me , when can we use it ,???\\nAlright boys, just another 10 years before immortality\\nDo you know why Google is behind ChatGPT? It\\'s because it takes ages for the public to gain access and use it in their daily tasks.\\ngreat era we\\'re livin\\' in.\\nWe\\'re excited to dig on on this ASAP. Gib ULTRA pls.\\n❤\\nI was in the process of building an app with gpt-4 but if Gemini really is as good as Google claims it is then I would love to switch to it instead\\njust tried it and don\\'t seem that different from previous version\\n😱😀🙂😐😔🙁☹😮🙃\\nan ai that is better than humans at everything. great idea google. there\\'s nothing that could possibly go wrong with this...\\nErhm... last \"eye of the storm\" vid sequence. It starts out with a city, zoom up, you see the eye of a storm, further zoom up, you see the eye of the storm is in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Such realism. Much wow.\\nI hope this is not a giant Woke exercise!\\nI am getting really afraid as a software engineer. Won\\'t be replacing entry levels anytime soon, but I think the time is ticking\\nSatanists.\\ncant wait to exploit it\\nThe 21st century space race\\nI used to be big into Google but they went all into India and became like yahoo in the early 2000s and said innovating and started acquiring to fix their issues and dropping products very quickly so yeah I am not interested\\nHow about we dont put restrictions on this one or insert any political biases into its responses. Thatd be great.\\nGemini-nano \"on-device\"? Sounds very promising. Would it be something like Llama 2?\\nExcited for the tech but really worried about Sundar\\'s health.\\nomg  i just want to say omg！\\nNow you just need to add movement and we can all have our personal robots that can do anything for us.\\nBut when will you release Gemini for public ?\\n\\n🙏🏼 please do it fast.\\nDEAR MR.

Is it open sourced?\\nthe future is here and not gonna lie, it\\'s both exciting and terrifying\\nLets just see when Google sunsets another one of their products.  Any bets??\\nVery interesting!\\nWe all gonna die\\nAmazing ! a other ultra censored model made by the most untrustworthy company in the world.... pass.\\nThe competition is just heating up. Let\\'s see how Gemini grows.\\n\"everyone, everywhere in the world\" SO WHY YOU DON\\'T LET IRANIAN PEOPLE USE BARD OR MOST OF THE GOOGLE SERVICES?!!!\\nWow, I remember Demis Hassabis from his working with Peter Molyneux on Black and White game.

What a waste of time.\\nIt\\'s interesting and gonna be a great use for people. A step towards Universal AI Model...excited to see its capabilities! hope the world of AI is shaping a new AI era with Gemini\\nThis is a great video but we need to see in action google\\nWoke AI\\nJust in from google: Gemini will be shuttered starting December 15th 2023 and shut down on January 1st. No refunds.\\ntoo late take the L\\ni cannot wait to get an access to api\\nSoo many bots in this comment section.\\nso the mind virus killed it before it even came out. a shame really, google was such an interesting company 15 years ago.\\nSo Gemini Ultra will be GPT-4 level judging by the metrics posted in their blog. Which is fine but one has to wonder how much more  OpenAI are still ahead. Giving they sat on GPT-4 for more than a year before being released. They are probably working if not ready again in secrecy with GPT-5. And with the rumors of Q* that is capable of destroying AES-192 Geee idk guys still kinda late to the party, sorry\\n\"it is as good as the best expert humans\" The thing with experts is that they are most of the time wrong. They have false models, narratives without any evidence, and they repeat each other, creating an echo chamber. There are so many misconceptions in \"science\" and social fields like economy that get repeated over and over again. Use those and ask an LLM, it will never break out of the mainstream answer. Those models will never find new ways. Impressive technology, but it can´t replace original thinkers. Imagine we wake up and there is a model that gives you a scientifically correct answer. It would be anything but politically correct. It would be anything but in concert with the view of big pharma and all the other big industries and institutions. They heavily depend on narratives that are wrong but intuitive aka fallacies. Historically heads have to roll until a new discovery goes mainstream. Think about Galileo or Martin Luther. Their models were not correct either, but they were able to disprove the old ones. If there really was an AGI, your whole worldview would implode.\\nI need gemini better than AGI\\nI Love Google and I Support This Company Forever❤️\\nI can\\'t wait for new Google Bard and new Google assistant. Google is really the king of AI in the World🔥❤️\\nBut is it better than chat GPT 4? 👀\\nShut your company down\\nLOL \"How can we censor every aspect of culture to promote Marxist materialist post-modernism?\" Well done. A truly useless product.\\nPeople have no idea of the scale of change these tools are about to unleash. My hope is that people use these as productive rather than destructive tools.\\nmake it affordable and accessible otherwise IDGAF what google is doing\\nOKay computer.\\nWhat are “on device tasks” ??? Thank you in advance from a technical baby 😂\\nI am sorry but I have been interacting with public available ai system for a while. \\nAnd I have noticed that as soon as chatgpt hit the scene, Google searches became dumber and provided information incorrectly more than usual. \\nWhen Google bard started, it was quite smart and with these recent updates, it is garbage currently. \\n\\nThe fact of the problem is that these ai systems are more hyped than the fact.\\n\\nRoughly 90% of all products fail to meet the expectations and promises.\\n\\nI am really hoping that one day we will be free from garbage and we experience heaven while alive.\\nGoogle is and should remain the Industry standard of Innovation. A truly exceptional company.\\nSuper excited for this new launch. However it would have been nice to get Gemini Ultra in Bard. it\\'s nice to see Gemini already being better than GPT4. Does it also accept files/PDF like GPT4?\\nOpenAI needs to launch Q* as soon as possible to stay ahead in the AI arms race. Yes it is an arms race now. Microsoft will not let Google get ahead erspecially now since it has more control over the OpenAI board. Brace for the AGI impact.\\nAnd the most amazing thing is It\\'s going to be live soon in bard and that\\'s also for free, its always exciting to be able to explore these capable models for free 😊😌\\nGood work Google !!\\nVery bad presentation, absolutely bad, of something that looks even worse.\\nWhat are you trying to say ???  It\\'s absolutely not clear what google is doing here or what it is trying to offer to the world ?  Its not clear, Something fishy.\\nAh so you\\'ve already crippled it with \"safety laws\".\\nPaid comments , no stats comparison to other models, HUGE L\\nHow does it perform against GPT4? Why did it take you so long? Will it be able to take on OpenAI Q?\\nI really want to be one of the first to try it.... Great work Google\\nGreat. 🎉❤\\nAi ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai ai 🥱\\nGemin-AGI.\\nHis names in AI\\nOof the safety team gives strong woke vibes\\nM\\n\\nwhat\\'s happened to Sundar Pichai ?

Until then, ChatGPT king.\\nNice! Google is back!\\nWonderful. It needs more woke people like Tulsee Doshi. I am sure their productivity is through the roof\\nGroundbreaking products such as Google Glass, Google Tango, and Google Plus!\\n❤\\nI love how in the final animation there is a house in the eye of a storm, with Gemini watching from above, undisturbed.\\nNew unprecedented censorship and control of public discourse is here, unforeseen even by great works of literature.\\nWe will all think \"proper thoughts\".\\nI see no signs of preventing this, which should be a priority.\\nIf this comment manages to be seen by anyone is a small miracle in itself.\\nBard sucks vs GPT-4.

GPT40's real time chat is so advanced that it could give those sci-fi AI companions a run for their money. Remember the AI girlfriend from the movie HER? Well, GPT40 is making that a reality. It can pick up on the tone of your voice, figure out if you're feeling happy, sad or anything in between and respond in a way that's genuinely helpful and supportive. But it isn't just about virtual companionship. It's also a master of language.

GPT40's ability to understand and express emotions is yet another game changer. Well, hello Bowser. Aren't you just the most adorable little thing? It can tell if you're feeling down or on top of the world just by the way you speak, and it can respond with the perfect words to match your mood. And get this, it can even change its own tone and vibe to keep things interesting. Heck, if you ask nicely, it might even serenade you with a song as they've showed at the demo.

It means that Gemini can understand the world around us in the way that we do and absorb any type of input and output. So not just text like most models but also code, audio, image and video. What's amazing about Gemini is that it's so good at so many things as we started getting to the end of the training. We started seeing that Gemini was better than any other model out there on these very very important benchmarks.

This theory combines the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, proposing that spacetime is a network of discrete loops and black holes are formed by the condensation of these loops. The theory offers a potential solution to the black hole information paradox and sheds light on the relationship between information and gravity.\\n\\n Introduction:\\n\\n The enigmatic nature of black holes has captivated physicists for decades. One of the most perplexing aspects is the fate of information that falls into a black hole. Stephen Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation suggested that information might be lost, leading to the infamous information paradox.\\n\\n Postulates of the Quantum Loophole Theory:\", metadata={'source': 'transcription.txt'}),\n"," Document(page_content='This theory proposes a novel approach to resolving the information paradox and understanding black holes. It is based on the following postulates:\\n\\n 1. Discrete Spacetime Loops: Spacetime is not continuous but rather a network of discrete loops woven together by quantum entanglement. These loops act as the fundamental units of space and time.\\n\\n 2. Black Holes as Quantum Loop Condensates: Black holes are formed when a large number of quantum loops collapse into a singularity, losing their individual identities and becoming entangled in a highly condensed state.\\n\\n 3. Quantum Hair and Information Preservation: Information about the collapsed loops is not truly lost within the black hole singularity. Instead, it becomes encoded in the quantum state of the black hole itself, manifesting as a subtle \"quantum hair\" around the event horizon. This hair contains information about the black hole\\'s mass, angular momentum, and other intrinsic properties.', metadata={'source': 'transcription.txt'}),\n"," Document(page_content='4. Hawking Radiation as Loop Emission: Black holes emit radiation, known as Hawking radiation, due to quantum fluctuations at the event horizon. These fluctuations cause pairs of virtual particles to be created, one falling into the black hole and the other escaping as Hawking radiation. This process can be interpreted as the emission of entangled quantum loops from the condensed state within the black hole.\\n\\n 5. Black Hole Evaporation and Loop Dissolution: As black holes emit Hawking radiation, they lose mass and energy. This corresponds to the gradual unwinding and dissolution of the entangled loop condensate within the black hole. Eventually, as the black hole evaporates completely, all the information encoded in its quantum hair is released back into the universe through Hawking radiation.\\n\\n Mathematical Framework:\\n\\n The Quantum Loophole Theory draws upon established mathematical frameworks, including:', metadata={'source': 'transcription.txt'}),\n"," Document(page_content='1.

Quantum Field Theory on Curved Spacetime: This framework provides the tools to analyze the behavior of matter and radiation in the vicinity of black holes.\\n\\n Originality and Contribution:\\n\\n While the individual components of the Quantum Loophole Theory might have been explored in previous research, the combination and application are novel. The theory offers a unique perspective on black holes, bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity and providing a potential solution to the long-standing information paradox.\\n\\n Open Questions and Future Research:\\n\\n The theory raises several intriguing questions for future investigation:', metadata={'source': 'transcription.txt'}),\n"," Document(page_content='Can the theory be experimentally tested through observations of Hawking radiation or other black hole phenomena?\\nWhat are the implications of the quantum hair for the thermodynamics of black holes?\\nCan the theory be extended to provide a unified description of gravity and quantum mechanics?\\n Exploring these questions and further developing the theoretical framework will contribute significantly to our understanding of black holes, the nature of information, and the fundamental laws governing the universe.\\n\\n Conclusion:\\n\\n The Quantum Loophole Theory presents a promising approach to unraveling the mysteries of black holes. By combining established concepts from quantum mechanics and general relativity, it offers a fresh perspective on information preservation and the relationship between gravity and the quantum world.

It combines the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, proposing that spacetime is a network of discrete loops and black holes are formed by the condensation of these loops. The theory offers a potential solution to the black hole information paradox. The Quantum Loophole Theory is based on three postulates: 1. Spacetime is a network of discrete loops woven together by quantum entanglement. 2. Black holes are formed when a large number of quantum loops collapse into a singularity. 3. Information about the collapsed loops is not truly lost within the black hole singularity, but becomes encoded in the quantum state of the black hole itself.\n","Reference context:\n","Document 117: Quantum Loophole Theory of Black Holes: A Novel Approach to Information Preservation\n"," Abstract:\n","\n"," This paper presents a novel theoretical framework for understanding black holes, the Quantum Loophole Theory. This theory combines the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, proposing that spacetime is a network of discrete loops and black holes are formed by the condensation of these loops. The theory offers a potential solution to the black hole information paradox and sheds light on the relationship between information and gravity.\n","\n"," Introduction:\n","\n"," The enigmatic nature of black holes has captivated physicists for decades. One of the most perplexing aspects is the fate of information that falls into a black hole. Stephen Hawking's discovery of black hole radiation suggested that information might be lost, leading to the infamous information paradox.\n","\n"," Postulates of the Quantum Loophole Theory:\n","\n","Document 118: This theory proposes a novel approach to resolving the information paradox and understanding black holes. It is based on the following postulates:\n","\n"," 1. Discrete Spacetime Loops: Spacetime is not continuous but rather a network of discrete loops woven together by quantum entanglement. These loops act as the fundamental units of space and time.\n","\n"," 2. Black Holes as Quantum Loop Condensates: Black holes are formed when a large number of quantum loops collapse into a singularity, losing their individual identities and becoming entangled in a highly condensed state.\n","\n"," 3. Quantum Hair and Information Preservation: Information about the collapsed loops is not truly lost within the black hole singularity. Instead, it becomes encoded in the quantum state of the black hole itself, manifesting as a subtle \"quantum hair\" around the event horizon. This hair contains information about the black hole's mass, angular momentum, and other intrinsic properties.\n","\n","Document 121: Can the theory be experimentally tested through observations of Hawking radiation or other black hole phenomena?\n","What are the implications of the quantum hair for the thermodynamics of black holes?\n","Can the theory be extended to provide a unified description of gravity and quantum mechanics?\n"," Exploring these questions and further developing the theoretical framework will contribute significantly to our understanding of black holes, the nature of information, and the fundamental laws governing the universe.\n","\n"," Conclusion:\n","\n"," The Quantum Loophole Theory presents a promising approach to unraveling the mysteries of black holes. By combining established concepts from quantum mechanics and general relativity, it offers a fresh perspective on information preservation and the relationship between gravity and the quantum world. Future research and experimental verification will be crucial to validate the theory and unlock its full potential for revolutionizing our understanding of the universe.\n","\n","Document 120: 1. Discrete Spacetime Models: Loop Quantum Gravity and spin foam models provide a foundation for representing spacetime as a network of discrete loops.\n","\n"," 2. Entanglement Formalism: The theory utilizes the well-developed framework of quantum entanglement to describe the interactions between individual loops within the black hole.\n","\n"," 3. Quantum Field Theory on Curved Spacetime: This framework provides the tools to analyze the behavior of matter and radiation in the vicinity of black holes.\n","\n"," Originality and Contribution:\n","\n"," While the individual components of the Quantum Loophole Theory might have been explored in previous research, the combination and application are novel. The theory offers a unique perspective on black holes, bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity and providing a potential solution to the long-standing information paradox.\n","\n"," Open Questions and Future Research:\n","\n"," The theory raises several intriguing questions for future investigation:\n","******************\n","\n","Question 17: What is the user's concern about Google's AI model, Gemini, and what is their expectation from it in terms of call tracking?\n","Reference answer: The user believes that Google's attempt to rush an AI model, Gemini, after the launch of chatGPT will backfire significantly as they think it's not ready yet.

It also suggests that there is a lack of regulation to control those who are profiting from AI, potentially at the expense of humanity. The text also implies that AI could contribute to environmental damage.\n","Reference context:\n","Document 125: the presumptions underlying AI's public reception are truly wrong, and/or truly appalling. Effectively we are counting on blue-sky assumptions about human restraint and \"altruism\" that have always been laughably quaint.

open AI just dropped a bombshell at their spring update event on Monday. They&#x27;ve unleashed a brand new model called GPT40 and trust me, this thing is going to change the game like never before. So what&#x27;s the big deal about it? For starters, it&#x27;s packing some serious GPT4 level power and here&#x27;s the kicker, it&#x27;s available to everyone even if you&#x27;re not paying for a subscription. Open AI&#x27;s headhuncho, Sam Altman had been dropping hints about some cool new features coming to chat GPT and GPT4 and...\",\"older sibling GPT4 could already analyze images and text, but GPT40 takes it to the next level by throwing speech into the mix. This means you can actually talk to the AI like you would with a real person and impressively there is almost no latency in this interaction. The AI responds to spoken input almost instantaneously ensuring a smooth and immediate conversation. GPT40&#x27;s real time chat is so advanced that it could give those sci-fi AI companions a run for their money. Remember the AI girlfr...\",\"What would you say? Mike, she wonders if Wales could talk what would they tell us? They might ask, how do we solve any equations? So an Italian and an English speaker having a full-blown conversation with GPT40 instantly translating every word, which is another cool thing it can do now. GPT40&#x27;s ability to understand and express emotions is yet another game changer. Well, hello Bowser. Aren&#x27;t you just the most adorable little thing? It can tell if you&#x27;re feeling down or on top of the world just b...\",\"voice at lightning speed, dishing out tips on breathing techniques and even analyzing the presenter&#x27;s breath sounds to give some personalized advice. We&#x27;re talking real time interaction that puts those clunky, slow poke AI models to shame. But it gets even better. GPT40 isn&#x27;t just smarter than its predecessor, it&#x27;s also faster. Open AI says this new model is a speed demon compared to GPT4, which means smoother, more snappier conversations. This new model is like the iPhone of AI. Open AI didn&#x27;t ...\",\"They&#x27;re making this incredible tech accessible to all. Although paying users will get a bit more horsepower under the hood. The potential of GPT40 is absolutely insane. It could revolutionize everything from virtual assistance to online learning and who knows what else.

This theory combines the principles of quantum mechanics and general relativity, proposing that spacetime is a network of discrete loops and black holes are formed by the condensation of these loops. The theory offers a potential solution to the black hole information paradox and sheds light...\",\"This theory proposes a novel approach to resolving the information paradox and understanding black holes. It is based on the following postulates:\\\\n\\\\n 1. Discrete Spacetime Loops: Spacetime is not continuous but rather a network of discrete loops woven together by quantum entanglement. These loops act as the fundamental units of space and time.\\\\n\\\\n 2. Black Holes as Quantum Loop Condensates: Black holes are formed when a large number of quantum loops collapse into a singularity, losing their individ...\",\"4. Hawking Radiation as Loop Emission: Black holes emit radiation, known as Hawking radiation, due to quantum fluctuations at the event horizon. These fluctuations cause pairs of virtual particles to be created, one falling into the black hole and the other escaping as Hawking radiation. This process can be interpreted as the emission of entangled quantum loops from the condensed state within the black hole.\\\\n\\\\n 5. Black Hole Evaporation and Loop Dissolution: As black holes emit Hawking radiation,...\",\"1. Discrete Spacetime Models: Loop Quantum Gravity and spin foam models provide a foundation for representing spacetime as a network of discrete loops.\\\\n\\\\n 2. Entanglement Formalism: The theory utilizes the well-developed framework of quantum entanglement to describe the interactions between individual loops within the black hole.\\\\n\\\\n 3. Quantum Field Theory on Curved Spacetime: This framework provides the tools to analyze the behavior of matter and radiation in the vicinity of black holes.\\\\n\\\\n Origin...\",\"Can the theory be experimentally tested through observations of Hawking radiation or other black hole phenomena?\\\\nWhat are the implications of the quantum hair for the thermodynamics of black holes?\\\\nCan the theory be extended to provide a unified description of gravity and quantum mechanics?\\\\n Exploring these questions and further developing the theoretical framework will contribute significantly to our understanding of black holes, the nature of information, and the fundamental laws governing the...\",\"References:\",\"Rovelli, C.
